# Image-Inpainting-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
**Image Denoising Web App**    A web-based tool for enhancing noisy images using Autoencoder, GAN, and DDPM. DDPM provides the best visual results, while Autoencoder performs better on some images based on PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. Built with Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and a simple web interface for easy image processing.
